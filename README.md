# Macaulay_duration_bond_convexity

## Description
This project analyzes bond duration and convexity, calculating key metrics like Macaulay Duration, present values, weights, and bond price variations at different yields to support understanding of bond sensitivity to changes.

## Files
- `Bond_Duration_Convexity.xlsx`: Excel file with bond duration and convexity calculations, including Macaulay Duration, present values, weights, and bond price variations at different yields.

## Macaulay Duration
Macaulay Duration measures the weighted average time until a bond's cash flows are received, expressed in years. It is calculated by multiplying the present value of each cash flow by the time period it is received, dividing by the bond's current price, and summing the results. In this project, the Macaulay Duration is computed as 5.23 years, helping to assess the bond's sensitivity to changes.

## Visualization
The Excel file includes a line chart that illustrates how the bond price changes (alakul) with varying yields to maturity (e.g., 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%), providing a visual representation of bond price sensitivity.
